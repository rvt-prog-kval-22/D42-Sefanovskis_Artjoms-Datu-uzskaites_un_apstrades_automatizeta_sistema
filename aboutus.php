      <p class="text">
      We always start from alloys and arches. We want to minimise brake dust and heavy abrasive dirt splashing onto your paintwork. Also the dirt from the alloys and wheel cleaning fluids go onto the dirty car which is then rinsed and washed after. We are trying to use the best practices how to wash your car in a safest way as possible. We never use the same cleaning brushes, tools and drying towels we are using for alloys to another parts of the car. We always working with 1 alloy at a time and we are using only high quality ph-neutral alloy cleaners. We are also using biodegradable products that are not expected to be hazardous to the environment. Our goal is to be Eco-friendly that’s why we carefully made a research about each product and it’s environmental precautions.

      <p class="text">
      Modern day car paintwork finishes: primer coat followed by base/colour coat and finally clear coat. The clear coat finishes vary considerably from one manufacturer to another (and sometimes from one model to another). It is important to understand the coat finish type and depth before machine polishing, as with the introduction of harder clear coat finishes polishing by hand to remove swirl marks will be very hard work. We offer three stages of machine polishing. The aim is to remove as many blemishes as possible without compromising the finish on your car and didn&#39;t cut clear coat too deep trying to get perfect “showroom finish” where your car loose almost all ultra violet protection.

      If the scratch deep enough to hit a primer coat, the area will immediately become susceptible to further damage such as rust. We recommend you to immediately show your car to a local paint shop specialist that they can do a local repair of the area affected. However in some cases we can help and restore it.
      We lightly apply the correct colour of paint over the damaged section with a tiny tool. Then we polish the area and fill it with protective coating that will make scratch almost invisible.

        UV PROTECTION
        </h2>
        <span class="second-header-line"></span>
      </div>
      <p class="text">
      Ultra Violet Radiation (UVR) protection a clear coat paint (Isocyanate Polyurethane) provides the colour and base coats with protection, and usually has UVR protection added in the final coating; this tends to migrate towards the upper level of the clear coat. This is why is important to check how much of the paint surface we are removing with an abrasive polish. The important thing to get here is that over polishing is going to lead to your clear coat getting thinner and thinner until it has lost the UVR protection. We recommend to apply wax on your car right after washing it. Most high quality car waxes have built in UV protection. Applying a protective layer is a good start for preventing damage before you have to fix it. If you&#39;ve ever had a vehicle with faded paint, you have witnessed the effects of UV damage. UV rays can lead to paint oxidation which eventually will result in fading and peeling. The extra protection with polymer we have announced at a very start will help ensure every customer&#39;s car will get up to 90 days paint protection from UVR.

      <p class="text">
      What if the basic 90 days protection is not long enough?
      Like all coatings, no coating is completely “apply and forget”, so you should continue to reapply recommended amount over period time to avoid damage to your paintwork from UVR, debris and contaminants that would otherwise embed themselves into the paint, eventually causing swirls and scratches. In general though, our protective polymer will last 90 days, most waxes are gone after 2 to 8 weeks.
